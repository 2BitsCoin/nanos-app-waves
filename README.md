# Introduction

This is a proof-of concept Ledger Nano S wallet app for Waves platform.

Special thanks to Jake B. for his support and advices.

# Building

You'll need a Ledger Nano S development environment.  More information can be 
found here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-devenv/ or in our wiki https://github.com/wavesplatform/nanos-app-waves/wiki

## Web Integration

Note you need to enable "Web Browser" support in the app on the Ledger device
in order to switch from the standard communication protocol to the U2F 
protocol.
